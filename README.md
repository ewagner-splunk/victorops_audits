Scripts for auditing various elements of a VictorOps account:

* **VictorOps_User_Audit_INTERNAL.py** - This script is for internal use.  It uses the VO API to get a list of users and all their paging policy details, then audits the user's password age and paging details, chacking for bad paging policies (2 or fewer contact methods, default policy, only one page in the first 20 minutes etc.) then kicks out a .csv file with the audit results.

* **VictorOps_User_Audit_PUBLIC.py** - For sharing with customers if desired.  Customer must edit lines 25-26 with their API details.  This script uses the VO API to get a list of users and all their paging policy details, then audits the user's password age and paging details, chacking for bad paging policies (2 or fewer contact methods, default policy, only one page in the first 20 minutes etc.) then kicks out a .csv file with the audit results.
